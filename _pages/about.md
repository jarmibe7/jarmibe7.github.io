### 🤖 What I Do

I specialize in building **intelligent robotic systems** that blend:

- Control theory  
- Machine learning  
- Simulation
- Embedded Systems
- Mechanical design

My experience includes:

- **ML architecture design** for clinical research
- Designing **trajectory optimization** pipelines for autonomous agents 
- Developing **simulation frameworks**  for RL and generative modeling applications
- Programming **intelligent systems** for robotic arms and mobile robots

I'm especially passionate about making systems that **learn** and **adapt** to their environments in real time.
