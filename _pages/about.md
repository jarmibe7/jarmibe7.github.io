Hi, I'm Jared! I'm currently in my final year of my BS in mechanical engineering at Northwestern University, with a concentration in robotics. Starting Fall 2025 I will also concurrently be an MS candidate on the thesis track, as a member of Dr. Todd Murphey's [Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Lab](https://murpheylab.github.io/). 

I specialize in building intelligent robotic systems that blend mechanical design with control, machine learning, and simulation. I've worked on simulation pipelines, trajectory optimization, and embedded systems for robotic arms and mobile robots. I'm passionate about creating systems that **learn** and **adapt** to their environments. Some of my specific interests include AI/ML in robotics, simulation, dexterity, control theory, and medical robotics.

Links to my contact information can be found by clicking on the icons below. Don't hesitate to reach out! I would love to talk about both your research and my own, and I'm also down to chat about all things music, basketball, and cooking.
